## .NET C# Educational Lab Assignment - LINQ in Manhatten

## LINQ Query 
This is an educational assignment that focuses on LINQ Query (Language INtegrated Queries) and Lambda Expressions </br>

#### LINQ Documentation
You can read more about LINQ using the MSDOCS link (haha) below </br>
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/linq-in-csharp </br>

#### LINQ Turtorial
Use the link below to connect to a tutorial about LINQ Query. In my opinion this tutorial broke down the LINQ query in understandable bite size bits to undertand.</br>

#### Lamda Expressions
You can read more about Lambda Expressions in the MSDOCS link below </br>
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions </br>
"syntactic sugar" isn't the name of the article from Dixin's blog regarding Lambda expressions but it should be!</br>
This blog article dates back to 2009 but walks through the C# versions that introduced the use of Lambda expressions in C# </br>
https://weblogs.asp.net/dixin/understanding-csharp-features-5-lambda-expression </br>

### What to Know Regading LINQ and Lambda
_LINQ_ </br>
If you have worked with a database such as SQL then you will have a starting point to understand the basics of LINQ </br>
The use of FROM, WHERE and SELECT should be fammiliar to you. </br>
You should also be used to FILTER, JOIN, and GROUP. </br>
The above represent what we can do with the data in the database when queried</br>

_Lambda_ </br>
You will see a lot of prou documentation regarding the introduction of Lambda expressions starting with C# 3.0 along with LINQ at the time. </br>
The basic structure of a Lambda expression is as follows: </br>
parameters => (Lambda) body of expression; you may also have multiple statements for Lambda expressions in the body of expression. </br>
